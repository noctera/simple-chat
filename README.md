This is my project to learn Typescript, TypeORM and a little bit of SocketIo. Therefore I won't take to much efford in styling the messaging app

## Build React Frontend

```
npm run build-frontend
```

## Start Server
```
npm run start
```

## Or Combine those steps
(not recommended when frontent is already build, as it takes a little bit longer)
```
npm run build-start
```

## Make production build
```
npm run build-final
```
